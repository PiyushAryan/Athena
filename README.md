# Athena - Decentralized Cloud Storage

Athena is a decentralized cloud storage solution that leverages **React.js** and **Ether.js** frameworks. Built on blockchain technology, Athena provides a secure, transparent, and decentralized storage platform for digital assets.

## Features
- **Decentralized Architecture:** Uses blockchain to distribute data across a network of nodes, ensuring security and availability without a central server.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Crafted with React.js for an intuitive experience in uploading, downloading, and managing files.
- **Smart Contracts with Ether.js:** Transactions and interactions are managed using smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **End-to-End Encryption:** Ensures only authorized users can access their stored files.
- **Immutable Data:** Tamper-proof storage for reliable data integrity.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js @13, Tailwind CSS  
- **Blockchain:** Ether.js @5, Solidity  
- **Development Tools:** Hardhat, Pinata (for IPFS)
- **Other Requirements:** Metamask Wallet, Ethereum-based Blockchain
